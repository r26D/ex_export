Add support for github actions and change log generation


Add support for having a module with a stanard method

defmodule MyMethod do
  def execute(a)  do
  end
end

defmoulde Top do
require ExExport
ExExport.export(MyMethod, method: :execute)
end
This will pull in the module and change the execute method to be named based on the module so you
call 

Top.my_method(a)

#this would support the pattern I use in anothe rproject
